1. I build this project on lastest-version flask server and local mongodb server
   I develop and test this project on ubuntu 14.04

2. how to run code:
   1. you need to install mongodb, and bring up mongodb on default server and port
	1. follow this link, if you do not know how to install and start mongodb
	http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
	2. The default /etc/mongod.conf configuration file supplied by the 3.0 series packages has bind_ip set to 127.0.0.1 
	by default. Modify this setting as needed for your environment before initializing a replica set.
   2. you need to install flask framework
        1. tutorial on how to install flask
   3. after you install the above framework and data store, download the source code app.py and the file: listings.csv
	open command line prompt and run: 
		python app.py
        now the server is running
	open another command line prompt and run:
		curl -i http://localhost:5000/listings?min_price=100000\&max_price=200000\&min_bed=2\&max_bed=5\&min_bath=2\&max_bath=5\&page=1\&per_page=30
        or open a browser and type:
		http://localhost:5000/listings?min_price=100000&max_price=200000&min_bed=2&max_bed=2&min_bath=2&max_bath=2&page=1&per_page=30
	
	the parameter: page indicate the page num you want, and per_page indicate how many items per page


3. further improvement.
	1.Pagination via web linking, for each request, my current implementation will filter out all the matched items and return items on the specific page num. I think that maybe server side could cache the filtered data to improve performance
	2. I use raw database api: pymongo, maybe later I could use MongoEngine or Flask-SQLAlchemy extension for database
